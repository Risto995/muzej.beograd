</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Panorama of the town is described by 6 letter entries (A
- F). It is an unsuccessful and unrealistic attempt to
represent the town and new buildings constructed in the
end of XVII century. The author presents a classic view
of Belgrade viewed across the river (even with the hills
in background), and the new fortification in foreground
is placed in southern part of the town. A plan of
Belgrade fortress is placed in the upper left corner,
represented according to the siege of  E. of <A HREF="../sad/vojl_1.htm" target="gl">
Savoy</A>
 troops
in <A HREF="../sad/hron_4.htm" target="gl">
1717</A>
. The plan is in Italian language and it contains
a legend with 9 entries (1-9). Tamiš (8) is erroneously
noted as Tisa - &quot;Tibisco&quot;.
