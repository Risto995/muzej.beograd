 confluence.
Belgrade is represented from the southern, mainland side.
However, the draftsman did not have a good quality model,
and worked on the basis of inadequate literary
description. Therefore, he moved the whole Lower town
(placed on the banks of two rivers and protected in its
rear by the mass of Kalemegdan, i.e., the Upper town), to
the south side, and it hence appears as the southern
suburbia of the fort. Inner fortification (1) is marked
as a single unit, and it should have been represented as
a part of the Upper town. The konak (lodge) of pasha is
in the Lower town (4). Presentation of two-horned
bastions (initially constructed by the Turks after the
project of a Venetian - Andrea Cornarro) is significant.
A mark &quot;Fig. XI&quot; stands in the upper left corner,
implying without doubt that it is a part of an album or
atlas.
