<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TWO SCENES OF THE SIEGE AND CONQUEST OF BELGRADE IN 1688<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Two battle scenes are combined in the engraving, placed
one above another with a note that lower scene
chronologically precedes the upper one. The upper scene
represents Belgrade in the moment of final assault of the
besiege army and the conquest of town on 6 September
<A HREF="../sad/hron_2.htm" target="gl">
1688</A>
. Operations on the bank of Sava in the level of Ada
Ciganlija, construction of bridgehead, and unsuccessful
attempt of Turkish army to drive back the besiegers to
initial positions on the left bank of Sava are depicted
in the lower scene. In the lower left corner of both
scenes stands a figure of chief commander <A HREF="../sad/vlad_17.htm" target="gl">
Maximilian</A>

Emmanuel of Bavaria. The engraving contains 17 letter and
numerical entries, but the legend was probably placed in
the separate sheet which was lost in the course of time,
or it remained in the album (perhaps in a book) from
which the engraving has been torn off.
Titles were inscribed in ink subsequently for the upper
scene: <A HREF="../sad/hron_2.htm" target="gl">
1688</A>
, conquest of Belgrade by Imperial army under
the command of elected prince of Bavaria, and for the
lower scene: <A HREF="../sad/hron_2.htm" target="gl">
1688</A>
. Imperial army's  crossing of Sava to
Turkish bank. Both texts are in French language.
