<P>Hospital of the Red Cross Society is represented, a groundfloor house
with central entrance and a few people in front of it. Two boards with
Red Cross emblems are placed upon it. On the right boar one may read the
inscription in Cyrillic letters: &quot;Engleska (?) bolnica&quot; (English (?)
hospital&quot;). Three flags are placed on the house, and according to its
roof it may be assumed that the building had groundplan in the shape of
Cyrillic &quot;P&quot;, its courtyards tracts being higher than the part facing
the street. Position of flags  and height of courtyard tracts may imply
that it is a different view of the house represented in photograph
UR/10371, shot in 180 degrees angle. Sloping grounds indicate that the
building was placed in Kara&dstrok;or&dstrok;eva St.
