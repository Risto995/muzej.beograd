<P>We suppose that the sheet was torn off from an edition of
Muenster's Cosmography (Cosmographia universalis). The
prototype of this panorama is a woodcut by Resch with
representation of Belgrade attacked by Turkish forces -

Suleiman</A>
 the Magnificent. Even the error was copied,
because the drawing was not cut inversely (as if
reflected in mirror). The panorama is on page 1368. At
the top stands the following text: The sixth book (Das
Sechste Buch) about the siege of Belgrade (griechisch
Weissenburg belagert). Watermill on the bank of Sava
(Saw), Turkish yawls on <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 (Tonaw fl.), towers and
turrets in the Upper town and a large church in the
center of Lower town are all clearly visible. Below the
picture is a text (22 rows) about the siege of Belgrade
beginning with a fact that anno Domini 1457 (an error -
1456), the Turks besieged Belgrade. A description of
battles which took place before the conquest of town in
<A HREF="../sad/hron_1.htm" target="gl">

 then follows. A history of the Christian-Turkish
conflicts in South-East Europe since 1396 is represented
on page 1367, as well as a response of the king <A HREF="../sad/vlad_9.htm" target="gl">
Sigismund</A>

(Žigmund, Sigosmund).
