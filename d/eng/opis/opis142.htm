, and its defense by Turkish crew. The assault of
Christian cavalry and a group of captured <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_27');">
janissaries</A>

Emmanuel are represented in the lower left corner. A
group of Christians, the inhabitants of Belgrade,
represented on the right side, are watching the
victorious advance of besieging forces from the walls, in
prayer and delight. The brutality of this conflict is
testified by Turkish heads which were cut off and stuck
on cuirassier spears, and fixed upon the already taken
ramparts. The appearance of Belgrade in this engraving is
not realistic, as it reminds to some north German,
Flemish, or Dutch town. Even the towers in Belgrade are
represented with sharp conical roofs, only the mosques
are realistically depicted. However, the content of
particular scenes corresponds to actual historical events
in the field. For instance, heavy mortras marked by (12)
were brought from <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo3');">
Buda</A>
 after almost one month of delay,
and with help of these weapons the fortified (casemated)
town gates (16) were penetrated. Panoramas of the
fortresses at <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Zemun</A>
 and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo31');">
Panƒçevo</A>
 are represented in the
upper part of the sheet.
<P>
The engraving contains a large number of letter and
numerical markings, but the legend, i.e. the sheet with
explanation of markings disappeared, remaining
undiscovered. It probably was not printed at all, because
the number of markings is 40.
