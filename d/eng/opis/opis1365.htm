<P>Representation of the Church of the Holy Assumption (Vaznesenska crkva)
in Kneza Milo&scaron;a St. No. 18, between Narodnog fronta and Admirala Geprata
St. Its frontage in Admirala Geprata St. is visible as well as its
northern facade looking over desolate ground. A fence (non-existent now)
built in masonry  encircles the church, and a large tree stands on the
right side. According to the evidence obtained by IAB (Istorijski  Arhiv
Beograda) from Moscow, the photo represents  &quot;The Church of Invalides
and the mulberry tree under which the delegates (of the St. Andrew
assembly taking place nearby in the so-called Great brewery) have
excavated a trench.&quot;
