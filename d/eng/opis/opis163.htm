<P>A view of Belgrade from the southern, mainland side.
Among many small family houses there are several large,
European looking storied houses. In the center, slightly
to the left is the barrack with lined up soldiers. Among
other objects one may note Saborna crkva (Cathedral
church), and Patriarchy across it (<A HREF="../sad/term_36.htm" target="gl">
Metropolitan</A>
 palace)
with a cross above its entrance. To the right of the
church is Old building (probably), the two-storied
building with two naves in Kralja Petra St. (demolished
in 1938). In the foreground are several men and women
clad in &quot;Serbian town dressing&quot;, a Turkish rider, and to
the far right are two Serbian officers riding and wearing
high fur hats (&quot;čak&quot;) decorated by tufts. <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Zemun</A>
 is
perceptible in the background of Sava, downstream to the
far left, as well as the frontier guardhouses on the
mouth of Sava.
