<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>SCHEMATIC PLAN OF THE BELGRADE FORTRESS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>This plan was created after renovation and construction
of the two-horned bastion - according to the plan of the
Venetian Andrea Cornarro. Both two-horned bastions
(Hornwerk) are drawn although only the eastern one has
been accomplished. The plan lacks precise designations
and legends. The Lower town (Donja varoš - Wasser Stadt),
and the Belgrade castle are marked in the area of Upper
town (text is in German language).
<P>
The scale in fathoms (Toises) is marked in the area of
Lower town - 100 fathoms are 4,5 cm (cca 1 : 5.000). The
author's signature is below the scale with a note that he
sojourned temporarily  at the &quot;red hillside&quot; (rothen Han
- probably Hang, i.e., a hillside). The wind rose is
placed in the center of the left side, and the plan is
rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
