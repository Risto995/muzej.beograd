 of
Piri-pasha attack the Lower town from water and take it
over, preceding to the conquest of Belgrade. An error was
made during wood-cutting, i.e., it was not cut inversely,
and thus the mouth of Sava was placed at the east of
Belgrade. The same error occurred also in Muenster's
work. The Upper town fortifications are marked out, with
inner town and the Mill-tower (Muhlturm, Mlinarica) at
the mouth of Sava.

Immediately after the fall of Belgrade under Turkish
power, the Nuremberg printer Resch published a woodcut
which represented the above noted event.  These leaflets
circulated in Germany and were used in political dispute
during an argument between the followers of Reformation
and the Catholic reactionaries. As far as we know, there
were two different leaflets (although artistically
identical). The one that we have is without text, an
another one is almost quadrangular in shape  with a large
text at its top explaining the Turkish danger. This view
of Belgrade, the first one which had ever appeared, is
well known and for a long time it remained the only one,
and thus it served as a model  for the famous geographic
reference book - Muenster's Cosmographia universalis,
printed in Basel for the first time in the mid XVI
century.
