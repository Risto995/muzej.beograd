towers at each corner,  in addition protected by water-ditches. The
settlement is fortified by palisade, and linked to the land by pontoon
bridge built by Austrians, marked by D). Downstream of it is an old
Turkish bridge abandoned for further use. On the left side of the plan
is an explanation with A - D entries. Number 96 is marked in the upper
