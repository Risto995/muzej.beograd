ALEXANDER'S OR WURTEMBERG'S MILITARY BARRACKS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>A view of newly accomplished barracks. Several groups of
people are represented in the large vacant space in front
of it.  They are clad mostly in oriental (Turkish)
clothes, a few of them are in traditional dressings, and
only one among them (to the far right) wears European
clothes. Monumental building of Alexander's
(Wurtemberg's) barracks is behind them and its main
facade is shown. The main entrance with a large square-
based terrace above it, is placed in its center. The
building has two wings, each with ten windows and the
central tract. The building consists of the groundfloor
and two stories. The left, lateral facade is visible,
representing a modest copy of the main facade, also with
the main entrance and a terrace above it.
<P>
All the noted facts may imply that the building had a
size of 22 x 36 m.
