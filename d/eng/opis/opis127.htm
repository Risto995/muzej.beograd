<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>MILITARY MAP WITH PANORAMA OF BELGRADE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>This draft represents the surroundings of Belgrade and
<A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Zemun</A>
 with confluence of Tisa, Begej, Tami&scaron; and Sava to
<A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
, along with adjacent channels such as Ervenica,
Kusto&scaron;, Kara&scaron;, Dunavac Fizel etc., on 28 July 1788.
<P>
The map is just a schematic representation of a battle
scene, and with regards to the fact that it was drawn and
signed by an &quot;Imperial officer&quot;, it may not be thoroughly
precise. For example, <A HREF="../sad/geo34.htm" target="gl">
Vi&scaron;njica</A>
 (Visnitza) is placed to
the east of Belgrade, in the hilly area far off the
<A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
; <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Taurunum</A>
, the antique name for <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Zemun</A>
, is placed
near Ruma; the confluence of Bosut and Sava is placed to
the south, downstream of &Scaron;abac, etc. However, the map is
splendidly accomplished. At the top right stands an eagle
with thunderbolts, a symbol of war and victory. At the
left bottom, below the scale, the panorama of Belgrade
(its appearance in mid XVII century) is struck by
thunderbolts thrown by an eagle which stands on the pile
of Turkish corpses. Mars, the god, surrounded by Turkish
banners and thugs, stands on the pile of weapons opposite
to the eagle, carrying the shield (with Imperial  armour
depicted on it!) and a sword. In the corner at the far
right is a <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
, with turban above it, which holds a
legend for panorama with 5 entries in German language.
The wind rose is placed adjacent to the <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
. The
cardinal points are rotated for 180 degrees, and thus
they appear outside of the map border. Cardinal points
are additionally denoted in Latin. A portrait of the
sultan Abdul Hamid I, with a note that he was born in
1726 (A. H. ruled between 1774 and 1789).
