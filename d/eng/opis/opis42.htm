PANORAMA OF BELGRADE (GRIECHISCHWEISSENBURG)<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>A large (&quot;flaglike&quot;) panorama of Belgrade as seen from the Veliko ratno
ostrvo (Great war island). The preserved part of the panorama shows
Danubian part of Belgrade with the tower of Nebojša, an already buried
<A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 harbour and a part of the Upper town. There is a pontoon bridge
across <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 upstream of the town. Adjacent to the torn down part of
the sheet, there are two Danubian mills (&quot;<A HREF="../sad/term_42.htm" target="gl">
prekaja</A>
 &quot;). Below the panorama
is an explication with 6 entries, followed by a short history  and
description of the town (although partial because it was torn
down).Hence, the remaining part of explanation should have been placed
on the right (torn off) side. It is noteworthy that it represents one of
the most popular panoramas of Belgrade, which have been published very
frequently, and its prototype was a view of Belgrade by Michael Vening
with Bodehner's redaction. According to the preserved part of town
description and history, its names could be reconstructed as follows:
Alba Graeca (in Latin), as well as <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Taurunum</A>
 (wrong! It is the Roman name
of <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Zemun</A>
), Nandor Alba (in Hungarian). It is noted that the town was
besieged in 1440, 1450, 1493, 1494, and in <A HREF="../sad/hron_1.htm" target="gl">
1521</A>
 when it was finally
taken (in August). The army of the Bavarian prince Maximillian Emanuel
(the commander) occupied it in <A HREF="../sad/hron_2.htm" target="gl">
1688</A>
, but the Turks besieged it and took
it over in 1693. Finally, the town was besieged by the army commanded by
Eugene of <A HREF="../sad/vojl_1.htm" target="gl">
Savoy</A>
, and after a decisive battle with Turkish army which
arrived to help the besieged town, it was occupied by Christians on 19
August <A HREF="../sad/hron_4.htm" target="gl">
1717</A>
.
