<P>Agha (commander) leading a squad of &quot;<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_19');">
delis</A>
&quot; (Turkish offensive cavalry),
created in the sanjak of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo33');">
Smederevo</A>
 by Bali-bey. They were famous for
their fearlessness. <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_19');">
Deli</A>
 means mad, madly brave in Turkish. Their
equipment contained hides of ferocious animals and wings of predatory
birds as to give them more terrifying looks. They bear small flags on
their spears. In the explication they are identified as madmen (Narren),
comedians (Gaukler). It probably is so because the author translated the
Turkish word &quot;<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_19');">
deli</A>
&quot; literally, ignoring the historical context, when
relating it to this type of Turkish cavalry. Turkish colour guard then
follows consisting of 8 cavalrymen in two rows. Six among them are
carrying flags, and two of them are carrying &quot;<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_51');">
tugh</A>
 &quot; (old Turkish banner
- a horse tail), signified as &quot;barjak&quot; (identical to &quot;barjak&quot;), i.e.,
the sacred banner. Colour guard was composed of the Sultan's Court
dignitaries. The equerry is behind them followed by 5 horses which are
led by two stable-boys. Horses, covered by valuable dressings adorned by
gold and silver, are advancing one after another.
