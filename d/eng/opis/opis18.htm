<P>In contrast to previous scenes which represented integral units, this
sheet contains two separate scenes:
<P>
A) left: An opened tent with a group of people inside and the quard in
front of it. The tent belongs to Imperial (Austrian delegation) and
there is an &quot;apple&quot; at its top. In the left rear of the tent are the
Turks. Looking downwards there are: Ibrahim-pasha, <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_14');">

.
<P>
B) right: An opened Turkish tent with a crescent at the top, and a group
of people in its interior. Imperial representatives are on the left, and
the Turks are on the right. Emissaries - negotiators are placed at the
raised platform approachable by a carpet. The following persons are
represented there: 1) Imperial interpreter, 2) gentlemen patricians and
officers, and 7) general Oduyer's horse held by two seyzes (stableboys).
On the right side are: 3) Turkish interpreter, 4) pashas and aghas, 5)

janissaries</A>
, and 6) three Turkish carpets covering the floor and a
postament with seats for negotiators.
<P>
At the top of both pictures there are extensive explanations in German
language. For the scene represented on the left it is stated that it
shortly describes paying the first visit of Turkish emissary to count
Oduyer on 27 June 1719, which took place in a tent erected for that
occasion. After the reception, Turkish emissary received gifts worth
3.500 gulden. In return he offered a gift of 12 rolls of brocade. In the
legend for the picture on the right, a subsequent meeting of emissaries
is noted, which took place one day later, on 28 June, in the Turkish
camp. The tent and equipment are described as well as  the gift offered
to the count on that occasion: a horse with luxurious equipment and a
saber.
