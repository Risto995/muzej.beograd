discipavit in Filia Juda humiliatumes humiliatam.
Lam.lerem. C.D.V.S. tradidis in manu Inimici muro
Turnumejus... ogitavit Dominus discipare Murum
ejus...Luxitque antimurales murus peritem discipalus est.
Defixoe sunt im Terra Portae ejus.&quot; - i.e., in rough
translation: Lord is created, old enemy ruined Israel,
destroyed all his ramparts, dissipated the humiliated
daughters of Judas. The lament of Jeremiah C(hapter)
F(ive) V(erse) E(leven). He abandoned the ramparts of his
tower into the hands of enemy. The Lord created its
walls...he lamented over (the bulwark) of Christianity -
