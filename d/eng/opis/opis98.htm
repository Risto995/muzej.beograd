<P>A view of Belgrade and a part of Royal Imperial army at <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Zemun</A>
 in 1788.
In the front, on the left are the remains of Medieval fortification at
Gardoš, and the already formed settlement of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Zemun</A>
 below it. Battle
ships are anchored along the coastline at <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Zemun</A>
. In the front, in the
right corner is the emperor Joseph II with his headquarters. Behind him
are the echelons of soldiers and the representation of clash with Turks
on the left bank of Sava, in the level of Ada Ciganlija. In the rear is
the panorama of Belgrade under artillery fire, and in its interior are:
the settlement on <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
 terrace (2), Upper town of the Belgrade
fortress (1), Lower town (3), and Nova srpska varoš (New Serbian town)
beyond  fortified town (5). The panorama is furnished with explanation
with 14 numerical entries in German language. Entry no. 9 is erroneous
because one of the <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
 branches is marked as &quot;Sebeš&quot; - a branch if
Tisa. Ouside of the scene, in the upper right corner is number 8
implying that the sheet belonged to an album about the siege of
Belgrade, or about Austrian-Turkish conflicts.
