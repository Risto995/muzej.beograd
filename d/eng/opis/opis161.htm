<P>Representation of the siege of Belgrade in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_6');">
1739</A>
 in the
upper left corner, with explanation  that the great
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_17');">
vizier</A>
 besieged it with 90.000 men, 200 cannons and 30
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_23');">
mortars</A>
. Below the explanation is a legend with 1 - 8
entries, describing the positions of cannon and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_23');">
mortar</A>

batteries, Christian lines of defense, along with Turkish
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_20');">
contravallation</A>
 and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_20');">
circumvallation</A>
 lines with a camp
between them. The plan with a wind rose in the lower left
corner, represents Belgrade and fortress after the
reconstruction accomplished by Habsburgians according to
the finest  system of fortification - that of the French
Marshall Vauban (1633-1707). Below the wind rose is a
short explanation noting that after taking the fortress
over from Turks on 30 August <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_6');">
1739</A>
, it has been demolished
by the Christian army (an that is partially correct). A
legend with A - Z  (24 marks in total) and 1- 12 entries
in German language is placed in the lower right corner.
All important objects in he town and fortress are
represented. Bastions along the town line of defense are
marked by numbers 2 - 8 (in the same order as follows:
St. Mary, St. Elisabeth, St. Eugenee, St. <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_2');">
Benedict</A>
, St.
Charles, St. Joseph and St. Leopold). The large
(Alexander's or Wurtemberg's ) barrack is marked by
letter &quot;S&quot;, and by number 12 with dots are marked parts
of the town which were burned during the attack of enemy.
Veliko ratno ostrvo (Great War island) is erroneously
marked as Ada Ciganlija (Zigeuner Insul). A figure of the
god Mars stands above the legend, with flags behind it.
