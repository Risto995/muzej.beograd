 from the land. The picture
represents the siege of Belgrade, with arrangement of
objects and viewpoint almost identical to the work of
Shitz-Mansfeld (I1/468). Austrian senior officers are in
the foreground, and in the bottom stands a cavalryman
(Fieldmarshall <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vojl_2');">

?) in front of the large scroll
showing the plan of Belgrade. The lined up troops are
placed further toward the town, followed by approaches
and armed force in action. A large mosque is in the
center as well as a windmill to its right. The legends
are lacking.
