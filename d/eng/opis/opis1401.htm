<P>Representation of the gloomy winter landscape, with hills covered by
snow in far background. In the foreground to the right stands semi-
interred object of stone and earth, covered by earth. Its entrance is to
the far right. Human skull  is placed upon the cover, with (curiously)
preserved collar of the shirt and upper part of dressing.  It could
belong to a priest, skin taken  from his head and, according to ancient
Turkish custom, filled with hay and then sent to the command in charge.
Remnants of the victim remained on the noted shed.
