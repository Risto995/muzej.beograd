PANORAMA OF GYULA (GIULA)<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Panorama of Gyula, the town and the fortress. The town is fortified by
ramparts and a ditch filled with water. Aside from  town, the suburbia
protected by <A HREF="../sad/term_39.htm" target="gl">
palisades</A>
 could also be seen. In the lower left corner is a
note that Giula was not far from Veliki Varadin (Oradea), that its
importance was small, but that its fortress, taken by Christians in
1693, has however been preserved.
