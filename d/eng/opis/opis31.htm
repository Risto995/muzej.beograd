protected by <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_39');">
palisades</A>
 could also be seen. In the lower left corner is a
note that Giula was not far from Veliki Varadin (Oradea), that its
importance was small, but that its fortress, taken by Christians in
1693, has however been preserved.
