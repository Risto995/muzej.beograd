<P>Panorama of the town in the valley between hills. Several large houses,
and, to the left, rather large church with wooden belfry somewhat far of
it. Leafless tree is in the foreground with ten people, men and children
clad in rough felt dressings. Starting from the tree, along the street,
are lined up  posts with stretched wires (two wires). The wires are also
stretched across the tree (telephone line?).
