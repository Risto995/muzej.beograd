<A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>

are not depicted. Plans of four settlements are
represented: Be&zcaron;anija, <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Zemun</A>
, Belgrade (fortress and
town) and so-called Cigansko selo (Ziegeuner Dorf, Gypsy
village) which is located at the spot occupied by so-
called  Nova Srpska varo&scaron; in plans from the beginning of
XVIII century. Roads and recently constructed embankment
with bridges connecting the besiege troops with <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">

also drawn. Along the river coastline are the roads
leading from Belgrade to &Scaron;abac and <A HREF="../sad/geo33.htm" target="gl">
Smederevo</A>
. Two roads
are leading to the south: (the western one) to Banjaluka

and divisions the plan contains data about commanders,
i.e., the  place of origin of military units. Legends for
positions around the mouth of Sava and Veliko ratno
ostrvo (Great war island) marked by numbers 21 - 30 and
the letter C are above the text. Below the plan are
entries 1-20. Below <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
 in the lower left corner is
the panorama of Belgrade and <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Zemun</A>
 (18 x 6 cm) titled: A
view of the fortress of Belgrade from Serbian side before
the siege. The noted view, from eastern Vra&ccaron;ar, is very
rare, and below it stands a legend with (a - f) entries.
An outline of <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
