<P>The founder of the family firm is Hans Georg Bodenehr (1631-1704). He
started the business  in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo1');">
Augsbourg</A>
 in 1677 with publication of small
geographical atlases. Later, he continued the business with three sons:
Gabriel, Moritz (died in 1749) and Georg Conrad (no data about him). In
all probability, Gabriel  moved the business to Vienna at a certain
moment. An important endeavor was the publishing of &quot;Curiosity atlas&quot;
(Atlas curieux) in 1704-1737.
<P>
The album represented here is an unusual compilation of various pictures
from atlas along with a number of maps. Judging by these facts, as well
by fashion and spirit of the epoch, it probably represents a part of the
large edition of &quot;Force d'Europe&quot;.
