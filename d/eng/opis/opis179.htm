<P>The engraving is identical to the already described
depiction ascribed to (Abraham Ortelius) and represents
the siege and fall of Belgrade in <A HREF="../sad/hron_1.htm" target="gl">
1521</A>
. Its central part
is occupied by panorama of Belgrade, viewed from <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
.
The Turks are around the town, a part of them already
having broken into the Lower town. Eight yawls are
floating on <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 and the one in the foreground is
undoubtedly Turkish. Another 5 yawls float upstream of
the town carrying Hungarian and German defenders of
Belgrade (after the agreement on surrender on 29 August
<A HREF="../sad/hron_1.htm" target="gl">
