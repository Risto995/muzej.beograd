<P>Representation of the right bank of Sava not far from its mouth. A ship
with number &quot;4&quot; on its bow is anchored next to it. A closed structure
with small windows, single-winged door and Red Cross emblem at its side
is built upon the boat. British flag stands on the bow of the ship, and
Red Cross flag is in the rear of the noted structure. Unrecognizable
flag is at the stern (according to navigation rules and territorial
waters principle, it should have been the flag of the Principality of
Serbia). Both in the front and rear decks are nine people, one among
them wearing (British ?) uniform. It probably is the  ship for transport
of  wounded men, possibly containing a surgery.
