PANORAMA OF TIMISOARA (TEMESWAR)<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>A large mill on the river bank is placed in  frontal part of the
panorama of Timisoara.  Behind it, a bridge  leads to the fortified
town, surrounded by canals filled with water. Rectangular fort
reinforced by circular tower is placed in part of the  town seen on the
right. On the right side, outside the town, is a settlement with large
Christian house of worship. According to the short description and
history placed below the picture, the town was located &quot;between <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>

and Transylvanian forests&quot;, a surprisingly imprecise description. It is
noted that Turks conquered it in 1552, and that Christians took it back
after the famous battle of Petrovaradin in October 1716.
