<P>14 stableboys are leading an equal number of unsaddled horses covered by
red velvet dressing with golden embroidery. In front of them rides the
main equerry following  two messengers of the Court. All of them are
preceded by  a large emissary echelon in quadruple rows each containing
12 cavalrymen, 2 x 4 infantry soldiers, and finally, symetrically,
another 12 cavalrymen. In the lower corner there is an explanation about
the echelon represented (in this picture) by 96 cavalrymen and 32
infantrymen, i.e., in effect 1.700 soldiers: <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_24');">
