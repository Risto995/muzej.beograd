</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>The picture represents a view of Belgrade across the
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
, from Banat, so that a densely settled town is
seen on the <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
 terrace. Austrian soldiers and
officers are depicted next to the cannons, on the left
bank of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
. Positions of Turkish army are noted in
the rear of the town. The engraving is coloured in a
rough, unskilled way, and the thick layers of red  (on
town roofs and fortress, and the uniforms of Austrian
soldiers) and blue paint (soldier uniforms) have thus
literally obscured the picture. Below it, in German
language is written: The Imperial-Royal army.
