<P>This engraving is a simultaneous representation of map,
battle scene and panorama. The route of Imperial army is
inscribed between the aggregation place near Futog and
Belgrade as the final destination of besiege and
conquest. Apart from route, the map shows a scene of the
battle of Belgrade and the flight of defeated Turks
toward <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo33');">
Smederevo</A>
. A separate panorama of Belgrade is at
its bottom. Its  title in Latin language &quot;bellogradum ab
Eugeneio capitur&quot; (i.e., Belgrade seized by Eugenee)
conceals a <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_6');">

Imperial army through marshlands on the left bank of
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">

Belgrade. A group of officers is depicted along with
several infantrymen - the engineers establishing a
passage for the army with bundles of sticks - &quot;fascines&quot;.
Imperial warship &quot;St. Eugenee&quot; engaged in the besiege of
Belgrade is depicted on the unfolded scroll placed in the
upper right corner. Imperial armour of Habsburg, double-
headed eagle holding the Earth in the right claw, and the
Crescent in the left one, is placed in the upper left
corner. Below it stands the armour of the Kingdom of
Hungary, and the armour of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vojl_1');">

noted ones, armours of Slavonia (just above the panorama
of Belgrade) and Old Trivalia (above the legend in the
lower right corner) are also placed in the engraving.
