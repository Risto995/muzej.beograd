</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>A panorama of Belgrade (size of the picture 31,5 x 19,8
cm) viewed from the southern, mainland side. All parts of
the town are depicted, although the author (Sedlmayer)
did not possess the pictorial scheme, and hence, guided
by literary description, he placed the town (lower town,
i.e., in German texts Water town - Wasser Stadt)
erroneously into southern part of the town, along with
pasha's konak (lodge) (4). Depictions are as follows:
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Zemun</A>
 - &quot;Semblin&quot; (11), <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo31');">
Pan~evo</A>
 (10), pontoon bridges
across Sava  and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
 (9 and 8), large Imperial
battleship - river corvette (8) and Turkish yawls blocked
in the narrow part of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
 below the fortress (12).
Legend in German language with 1-12 entries is placed in
the lower right corner. A thorough geographical-
historical text about Belgrade stands below the picture.
The author made an error in listing because the Hungarian
name of Belgrade was printed &quot;Standoralben&quot; instead of
Nandor Alba (the name of Belgrade in Hungarian). As
regards the ancient history, he identified the town as a
powerful fortress and mentions the Serbian (Reissischen)
King Stefan Dragutin or Despot <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_10');">
Stefan</A>
 Lazarevi} who have
fortified it. Subsequently he deals with glorious
defenses of Belgrade during Turkish aggressions in 1440,
1456, 1494, and finally he notes the siege and conquest
in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_1');">
1521</A>
 by <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_6');">
Suleiman</A>
 the Magnificent. Afterwards, he
mentions that the army under the command of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_17');">
Maximilian</A>
 of
Bavaria seized Belgrade on 6 September <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_2');">
1688</A>
 during the
reign of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_11');">
Leopold</A>
 I, but that the town was taken over by
Turks once more on 8 October 1690.

The final part of the text notes that the sovereign
Emperor Charles VI and his army under the command of
general-lieutenant prince Eugenee of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vojl_1');">
Savoy</A>
 began the
siege on 18 June <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_4');">

 ( the year is not marked).
