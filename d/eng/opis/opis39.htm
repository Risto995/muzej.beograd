 as a town consisting
of several parts. Four parts of the town are placed on fortified river
islands, along with two fortified suburbia on the coast. Communications
with town and among its parts are represented by eight bridges. Parts of
the town placed on the islands are packed with large, solid buildings,
mainly mosques and churches, while the suburbia on the coast are
dominated by two mosques and one multistoreyed tower. Notes about town
are on the left side. It is explained that the town lays upon the river
of Sarva (Sarowitz) which forms a triangle with other two rivers.
According to the description, the town has five suburbia, three outer
and two inner ones. Since ancient times the Hungarian kings were crowned
there in a church which has no counterpart in the rest of Hungary.Turks
occupied the town in 1543, and Christians took it over again in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_2');">

been in the possession of Habsburgs. Nimber 165 is marked on the right,
