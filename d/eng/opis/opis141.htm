<P>Belgrade or Greek Belgrade (Weissenburg) situated between
the rivers of Sava and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
, called the lock opener of
Hungary. The title in Latin and German language is placed
within shell-like <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>
 in the upper left corner of
the plan. The whole sheet is a kind of compilation
accomplished in large format. The upper coloured part is
occupied by plan (A), and the lower non-coloured part is
the panorama of Belgrade (B).
<P>
A) Belgrade during Austrian government (1717-1739) is
shown in the plan. A delineation of new fortification
constructed by the Austrians during their government in
Belgrade and northern Serbia is marked out. At the same
time, new fortifications around Kalemegdan (Belgrade
fortress) are outlined (although rather inaccurately),
though the fortress representation corresponds to its
appearance during the siege of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_4');">
1717</A>
. A large <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>

with history of Belgrade is placed in the lower right
corner. It notifies that Plinius has already noted it as
(Latin) <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Taurunum</A>
, that Turkish Tzar <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vojl_1');">
Murat (Amurat)</A>

besieged it unsuccessfully in 1440, and that the siege
under the command of his son (<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_7');">
Mohammed</A>
 the Conqueror),
who besieged the town with150.000 men, was equally
unsuccessful. <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_6');">
Suleiman</A>
 I seized it in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_1');">
1521</A>
, and the town
remained in Turkish hands until the fortunate siege when
it was taken over by Imperial  forces under the command
of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_17');">
Maximilian</A>
 Emanuel of Bavaria. Finally, after the wars
terminated by treaty of Po`arevac, it was given to the
(German).Emperor. Construction of the Capuchin monastery
in 1735 is noted as the last event in the noted history.
Legend with 27 entries (A - Z and a - e) is placed in the
left corner, opposed to historical notes. It relates to
the explanation of  particular areas of the town, and
more important old and new constructed objects.
Historical notes and legend are both in German language.
In the bottom of the plan is the scale in fathoms
(Toisen), 100 fathoms are 2,8 cm, and as one fathom is
equal to 1,896 m or 1,949 m, the scale is cca between 1 :
6771 and 1 : 6960. The plan is 35,3 cm large (height).

Greek White town (Weissenburg). Both upper corners are
occupied by legends with 7 entries in total (a - g). The
work is a copy of Bodenehr's (Gabriel Bodenehr) panorama
of Belgrade.
