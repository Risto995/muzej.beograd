</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Representation of simplified groundplan of the town of
Belgrade, with a ceremony of exchange of Imperial and
Turkish emissaries on 10 June 1740. A small panorama (19
x 5,5 cm) of Belgrade viewed from <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 is placed in the
upper right corner,  and its own legend: A view of the
actual fortress of Belgrade. Certain important objects
are marked in the Upper and Lower town such as the
arsenal (gun-powder depot) (9) and the main guardhouse
(7).
<P>
The middle part of the plan is occupied by groundplan of
the fortified Belgrade, with Nova Srpska savska varo&scaron;
(Racenstadt, New Serbian town on Sava) outside the walls,
on the junction of actual Narodnog fronta St. and
Balkanska St. The hospital building and mosque are also
placed outside the walls, at the location of the present
National Assembly (<A HREF="../sad/term_13.htm" target="gl">
Batal-d&zcaron;amija, Batal -mosque?</A>
) and the
quarry at Ta&scaron;majdan. The objects which were intended for
destruction, according to preliminaries of the peace
agreement in Belgrade in <A HREF="../sad/hron_6.htm" target="gl">
1739</A>
, are hatched. Important
undamaged objects (constructed during Austrian government
in Belgrade and Serbia in 1717-1739) which were given to
the Turks, are isometrically represented: barrack,
Alexander's (or Wurtemberg) barrack, commander's
residence and several Christian temples (Catholic orders
- Jesuits, Franciscans, Minorites and White Friars).
Barracks, depots and arsenal in the fortress (Upper and
Lower town) were also handed over undamaged. Certain
events of that period were also depicted, such as the
departure of Austrian units and men who have destroyed
the fortification, as well as the most important event -
celebration and salute of the artillery from Austrian
battle ships marking the exchange of emissaries on 10
June 1740.
