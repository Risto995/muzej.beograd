<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>ALBUM OF CUNO VON QUITZOW (FRONTISPIECE)<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>This album is not complete but represents a collection of preserved
sheets. The last <A HREF="../sad/term_38.htm" target="gl">
page</A>
  or wrapping was not preserved. The author of this
album, Cuno von Quitzow, remained unknown to us. Rare occurrence of the
album in collections is logical as it has been created at the peak of
dynastic arguments in Serbia during mid XIX century. A change in the
seat of power and return of the dynasty of Obrenovi&cacute; (<A HREF="../sad/vlad_20.htm" target="gl">
Milo&scaron;</A>
 and Mihajlo)
to princely throne occurred within two years after the appearance of the
noted album. Members of the dynasty of Kara&dstrok;or&dstrok;evi&cacute; were banished, their
possessions confiscated, and their followers were also in trouble.
As far as we know, regarding the size of the album, at least one sheet
is missing - A view of the Rakovica monastery, although a larger number
of missing sheets should not be excluded.
<P>
Album of Belgrade was dedicated to the prince <A HREF="../sad/vlad_19.htm" target="gl">
Aleksandar</A>
 Kara&dstrok;or&dstrok;evi&cacute;.
Text in the frontispiece is in Serbian (left side) with a counterpart in
German (right side). &quot;To his Highness Serbian Lord and Prince <A HREF="../sad/vlad_19.htm" target="gl">
Aleksandar</A>

I Kara&dstrok;or&dstrok;evi&cacute; dedicated with reverence from Cuno von Quitzow (the name
transcribed in German only). An armour of the Principality of Serbia is
placed in the center of the sheet, within a white circle with radiating
lines.
