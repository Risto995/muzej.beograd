ISOMETRIC PLAN OF SZIGET<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>The plan shows an accurate position of Sziget in the marshlands at the
north of Drava. The town is placed on three islands. At the largest,
middle one, the old town is placed; on the smaller island on its left is
the new part of town, and on a thoroughly fortified island on the right
is the fortress with a castle, but also a mosque is perceptible. The
islands are interconnected by bridges, and a bridge linking the old town
and fortress is additionally reinforced by fortified gate. Historical
facts are noted on the left side of the picture, and also on the right
side in few lines. They begin with an explanation about  the town
location. However, the largest part of  text deals with Turkish siege
layed by <A HREF="../sad/vlad_6.htm" target="gl">
Suleiman</A>
 I the Magnificent in 1566, and the heroic resistance
of Nikola Zrinjski (Serini). It ends with a note that the town fell
under Christian command in 1689, after two years of blockade. The
explication contains entries from A to D. Number 153 is marked at the
top, on the right.
