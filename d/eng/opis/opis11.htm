spahis</A>

<A HREF="../sad/term_27.htm" target="gl">
janissaries</A>
 then follows with a commander at its front and in its rear.
They differ from the previous group in that they are, apart from guns,
equiped by sabers as well, and are signified as &quot;Defeckerisch&quot; - a term
which is almost untranslatable. The last echelon represents a group of
24 cavalrymen in three rows bearing small flags on their spears, led by
the agha. In the  right bottom there are 6 small cannons with two
attendants, which saluted a welcome to the Imperial delegation.
