</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>A view of Belgrade from the hill (located at Gardo&scaron; -
Be&zcaron;anijska kosa?) as if it were a bird's eye view. Four
people wearing European clothes are in the foreground,
and the left bank of Sava with Belgrade across it, is
below them. A small watercourse is represented close to
the mouth of Sava (probably an error), and the panorama
of Belgrade is in the rear of above noted depictions. The
town is divided into the fortress and suburbs with a
vacant area (an area on the ridge of Kalemegdan <A HREF="../sad/term_52.htm" target="gl">
Terazije</A>
 ,
still with no buildings and settlement). Three water
mills (<A HREF="../sad/term_42.htm" target="gl">
prekaja</A>
 ) are placed on the bank of Sava. Seven
ships, and a large sail-boat among them, are depicted on
<A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 toward the harbour. A short historical-
geographical description of Belgrade in Italian language
is situated  below the title. Its position (40 degrees
and 40 minutes of the northern latitude and 39 degrees
and 51 minutes of the eastern longitude) along with short
