</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>The title in Latin language is noted in a <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>
 in
the upper right corner - the true and new description
from 1717. The plan is created before the Austrian
reconstruction began, though with <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_20');">
circumvallation</A>
 line
(H) marked out around the town. The Lower town - &quot;Water
town&quot;, Vodena Varo{ (A) is noted, along with the Upper
town or interior settlement, encircled by ancient
ramparts (B). In fact it was the fortification renovated
during Turkish period, i.e., <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_16');">
Bolma hissar</A>
  (bol - in
Turkish means large, abundant), the interior
fortification of the Upper town - the castle (C), the
Lower town described as &quot;an old but renovated
fortification&quot; (D), the commander's residence  in the
Lower town (G), Srpska varo{ (Serbian town, &quot;Retzen
Stadt, &quot;La Citta delli Rasciani&quot;, &quot;La ville Rasciens&quot;,
&quot;Civitas Rascianorum&quot;) (F). Latin designations are marked
directly in the plan: the road to Osijek, the rivers of
Sava and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
, the <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
 harbour along with the Lower
town - &quot;Aquoeductus&quot;, and finally the road and bridge to
Timisoara. A legend with 8 entries (A - H) in Latin
language is in the upper left corner, formed as a
vertical scroll. A <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>
 in the upper right corner is
decorated by symbols of war - drums and banners, Turkish
on the left and Austrian on the right
<P>
A woodcut is added below the plan - a translation of the
legend into German, Italian, and French language, and at
the same time the translation of all texts in the plan.
Rather unusual translation into three living languages
was probably represented in order to increase the selling
of this plan. Although the plan is dated with 1717, the
town destructions were not depicted and thus it may be
assumed that the situation which immediately preceded the
war was represented, apart from the besiege line traced
by Eugenee of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vojl_1');">
Savoy</A>
.
The scale in common (traditional) fathoms is given next
to the legend in the upper part of the plan, and assuming
that &quot;common&quot; fathom was 1,896 m, the scale was cca 1 :
2.462.
