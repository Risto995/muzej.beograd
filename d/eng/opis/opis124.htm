</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>A situation of the town and its environs and the plan of
Belgrade is represented, i.e., the Greek white town, on
the banks of Sava and <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
, which was liberated from
the Turks with God's help and Christian arms. The title
is in German language and it is placed within a
horizontal scroll-like <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
 in the upper left
corner.
Belgrade is represented in this plan along the sharp arch
formed by Sava and <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
. The bridges across Sava and
<A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 (which remained after the siege in <A HREF="../sad/hron_4.htm" target="gl">
1717</A>
) are
marked by text, as well as the roads to Osijek, Timisoara
and <A HREF="../sad/geo33.htm" target="gl">
Smederevo</A>
, the inner fortification of the Upper town
(Das Schloss) and, downstream of kula Nebojša (the
tower),  the <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 harbour in which &quot;the ships could be
safely anchored&quot;. The plan contains 7 entries (A - G)
with  legend equivalent to the title, also in the form of
scroll, and in German language. The following objects are
noted: A) Lower town or Water town, B) &quot;Upper&quot; town
enclosed by old wall, i.e., the northwestern zwinger, C)
Old and renovated fortress - actually the Upper town, and
the attribute &quot;renovated&quot; relates to the attached
hornwerk (two-horned bastion) constructed in 1690s after
the plans of the Venetian Cornarro, D) northeastern
zwinger, E) Serbian town (Srpska varoš, Reittens Stadt -
obviously erroneous, it should stand Ratzen - Rasciani,
Rascian), F) Pasha's konak (lodge) in the Lower town and
G) Eugenee of <A HREF="../sad/vojl_1.htm" target="gl">
