semicircle between houses (the roof of one house is seen to the left,
roof of another house is to the right in background, and in to the right
in foreground  is the corner of third building built in stone masonry.
The first on the left is a priest, while the man and woman standing in

Knja`evac or Zaje~ar. Hills are seen  the background.
