Plan of war operations in the summer <A HREF="../sad/hron_4.htm" target="gl">
1717</A>
 was accomplished by the
conquest of Belgrade. The plan consisted of three unequal parts: 1.
Central part of the plan, 2. Plan of Turkish attack on positions of the
Eugene of <A HREF="../sad/vojl_1.htm" target="gl">
Savoy</A>
's army (in the upper right corner) and 3. Plan of the
battle at Belgrade with specified explanation (in the lower left
corner).
<P>
1. Central part of the plan:
It begins in the upper left corner with a plan of the Petrovaradin
fortress and the position of military camp near Futog. The initial
position of Haubstein corps is indicated (erroneously inscribed as
&quot;Howitzer&quot; - &quot;Haubitschen&quot; corps), and its advance along the right bank
of <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 between 23 and 26 June to <A HREF="../sad/geo35.htm" target="gl">
Zemun</A>
 (passing by Beška, Karlovci
and Slankamen), as well as its battle positions on the left bank of Sava
(between the river and Bežanijska kosa). The main forces advanced along
the left bank of <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
, across the marshlands, Tisa, Tamiš and <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>

branches, and arrived to the <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 shore upstream of its confluence
with Tamiš, near Belgrade. In the center of this plan is the plan of
Belgrade with position of Turkish garrison, consisting of 40 000 men.
Next to it is fortified Austrian camp between fortified lines
(<A HREF="../sad/term_20.htm" target="gl">
contravallation</A>
 line toward town and <A HREF="../sad/term_20.htm" target="gl">
circumvallation</A>
 one   toward
south), but also between Turkish garrison and the large Turkish army led
by great <A HREF="../sad/term_17.htm" target="gl">
vizier</A>
. The Turks arrived to Belgrade on 29 July and have
organized a camp with left wing leaning to Sava and the right wing to
<A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 trying to cross it and push the Austrians from their positions in
Banat.
Plan of Belgrade is schematically represented, but it is remarkable that
eastern, entirely completed two-horned bastion (Hornwerck) is shown.
Topographic explanation belongs to this part of plan (in the lower right
corner) with specific designations for grenadier company, infantry
battalion, dragon regiment, cuirassier regiment, hussar regiment and
Turkish formations (ordia) of <A HREF="../sad/term_48.htm" target="gl">
spahis</A>
 , i.e., the royal and feudal cavalry
and (ordia) of janissary infantrymen. In the center, on the left, is a
large explanation placed below a battle eagle with a sword in the left
claw, and a crescent and Turkish tuft (decoration on turban) in the
right claw. Explanation with 22 letter entries (A - Z) and 16 numerical
entries.
