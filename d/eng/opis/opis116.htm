</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>A new map of Hungarian kingdom with provincial borders
(in Latin). Apart from Hungary, this map encompasses a
part of the neighbouring countries - from Vienna in the
west to the Iron Gates in the east, and from central
Slovakia in the north to the region of Raška in the
south. A sort of topographic explanation is given below
the map indicating that forts marked by crescent are
occupied by Turks but that the cross above them signifies
their belonging to the Christian world. There are two
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouches</A>
 in the upper left corner, and one <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>
 in
the lower right corner with text about the authors. The
wind rose is in the center of map, and it may be noted
that the map orientation is moved for 30 degrees counter-
clockwise. Borders are partially marked by colour, and
several provincial armours are also included (fairly
precise - the armour of Croatia is coloured in black and
blue). Above the <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>
, at the lower right is the
representation of a battle between Christians and Turks
and the text explains that it concerns the unfortunate
campaign of the Emperor  <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_9');">
Sigismund</A>
 against <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_7');">
Mohammed</A>
  &quot;the
seventh Turkish sultan&quot;.

Latin was <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
