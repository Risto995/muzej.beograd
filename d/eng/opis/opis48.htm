Saray</A>
  (palatial complex of &quot;Seragli&quot;), and a map of Bosphorus
with all important sites marked at both of its coastlines. The upper
left corner contains a <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">

 with description and history of
Constantinople, but the text, due to its large size, continues over and
outside the <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">

the foundation of town and Constantine the Great, until the Turkish
conquest during <A HREF="../sad/vlad_7.htm" target="gl">

 the Conqueror (El Fatih), although an inversion
was made, and the year of Turkish victory is noted as 1543 instead of
1453.
