<P>The plan of Belgrade, capital of Serbia, occupied by
Turks in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_6');">
1739</A>
 is represented in this engraving. The title
is in French language, placed within a <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>
 of
column-like form, in the lower left corner. The map is
published in 1788, in the very beginning of Austrian-
Turkish war but after 24 April 1788 when Šabac was
already  conquered. Locations of  almost every conflict
with Turks in the area (since 1441) are noted. The
largest amount of data concerns the war and conquest of
Belgrade in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_4');">
1717</A>
. The route of Austrian army from Futog ,
via Titel and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo31');">
Pančevo</A>
 to Belgrade is also marked.  The
pictorial representation of Belgrade could be related to
1717 - a fort with two-horned bastions, i.e., Turkish
reinforcements from 1696.
<P>
A panorama of Belgrade placed in the upper right corner
may also be related to the end of XVIII and the beginning
of XVIII century. An Austrian officer and Turkish
nobleman are placed next to the <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('term_8');">
cartouche</A>
, and below
their legs another Turk is represented, his face
terrified and his hands folded in Christian mode, for
prayer)
<P>
All texts are in the French language, and the entire
engraving represents typical example of  a roundabout
propaganda of the  war goals. The map is geographically
rather imprecise..
