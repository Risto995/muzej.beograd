</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Representation of the appearance of glorious town and the
main crossing of Greek (orthodox) Weissenburg, i.e.,
Belgrade.
<P>
The engraving is divided in two separate, thematically
related parts. The upper, slightly smaller part
represents the panorama of Belgrade, viewed from the
north, across <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
, with the arrangement of  besiege
army around town. The following objects are clearly
marked in Belgrade, the Upper and Lower town: inner
fortification, entrance to the harbour, watermill on Sava
with pontoon bridge identified as the Turkish one (?). A
<A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
 (in the shape of laurel wreath) with dedication
to <A HREF="../sad/vlad_17.htm" target="gl">
Maximilian</A>
 of Bavaria, with entire citation of his
reigning title, is placed in the upper right part.  An
identical <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
 is placed in the left corner with
image of <A HREF="../sad/vlad_17.htm" target="gl">
Maximilian</A>
 of Bavaria (Dr. Rajko Veselinovi&cacute;
stated that it represented an image of the Emperor
<A HREF="../sad/vlad_11.htm" target="gl">
Leopold</A>
 I Habsburg, but it is not at all in accord with
the text of <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
 on the right, and the image itself
corresponds more to the archduke of Bavaria). The wind
rose is placed in the lower left corner, and the
schematic plan of Belgrade fortress titled &quot;Belgrad
Ichonographice&quot; is on the right, within a separate square
(6,3 x 6,3 cm), the Upper town is marked as Castle
(Schloss).
<P>
Lower scene represents the panorama of Belgrade viewed
from the southern, mainland side, along with arrangement
of infantry and cavalry (with names of the commanders)
and the moment of decisive assault for the seizure of the
town on 6 September <A HREF="../sad/hron_2.htm" target="gl">
1688</A>
. A legend with 11 letter entries
(A-L) in German language is placed in both lower corners.
