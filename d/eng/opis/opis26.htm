PLAN OF THE KLOSTERNEUBURG FORT<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Plan of the fortified town Neuheusel (Vywar in Hungarian), i.e., modern
Klosterneuburg or Nove Zamky on Nitra (Slovakia). The modern Hungarian
name of town is Ersekujvar. According to the plan, the town had a shape
of regular hexagon, with a fortified bastion at each angle, an
orthogonal street network and a square at its center. In the upper right
corner is the number 127, and in the lower one stands a scale in
Viennese ells (100 ells = 3,8 cm). In the lower left corner is the
section with a scale expressed in building feet (60 feet = 2,9 cm).
<P>
The town is surrounded by water and could be entered by two gates placed
at its opposite ends, with bridges located  at the north and at the
south (if the orientaion of plan was accurate).
Outside of the plan, both on its left and right border, the town history
is inscribed. It says, that Bocskay conquered the town with Turkish aid
in 1605, and that the Imperial forces brought it back in 1607. The Turks
took it over also in 1663, but  since 1710 the town was finally in the
control of Habsburgs.
