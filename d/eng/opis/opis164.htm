</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Representation of a broad panorama of Belgrade (identical
to the one preserved in album I1/5039, even the fold is
marked),  viewed across the confluence of Sava and
<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo5');">
Danube</A>
, so that Veliko ratno ostrvo (Great War island)
remains in the foreground. The inner fortification of the
Upper town is marked besides a castle (1), northeastern
and northwestern zwinger (5 and 4), commander's residence
in the center of Lower town (6), and the main mosque (7)
to the far right. An explanation in German language with
entries (1 - 9) is in both corners below the engraving,
and right at the bottom is the signature of G. Bodenehr,
the publisher.  Between two parts of the legend is a text
about Belgrade, its name (antique name for the town was
erroneously changed for antique name of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Zemun</A>

&quot;<A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Taurunum</A>
&quot;), and its history until the glorious victory
of Eugenee of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vojl_1');">
Savoy</A>
 in <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hron_4');">
1717</A>
.
<P>
The engraving was probably a part of large publication of
Gabriel Bodenehr, an album with more than 200 panoramas
of the most important European towns, published in
several volumes under the joint title &quot;Europas Pracht und
Macht&quot;. The text in German language says: Belgrade or
Greek White town.
