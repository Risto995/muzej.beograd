</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>The central, largest part of the scene is a panorama of
fortified Šabac (Schabatz) besieged by Austrian troops
under supervision of the Emperor Joseph II. In the
foreground are commanders of cavalry troops with the
Emperor among them (A). Fortified artillery positions are
on the sides with <A HREF="../sad/term_23.htm" target="gl">
mortars</A>
 (to the left) and cannons (to
the right)  bombarding Turkish Šabac and supporting the
attack of troops - the soldiers are already climbing the
town walls. Šabac, i.e., its fortress (Schloss) is
realistically represented - a rectangular space fortified
by ramparts, with circular towers at each corner. The
settlement is not realistically represented - it is
encircled by the high mighty ramparts built in masonry
and reinforced by towers, and the town and fortress are
additionally reinforced by large water ditch, a branching
of Sava. The engraving contains a legend with 6 letter
entries at the top (A - F) and a short history of the
conflict and a legend with 4 entries (1 - 4). All text is
in German language. Number 4 stands in the upper right
corner, implying that the sheet was torn out from some
album about Austrian-Turkish war.
