</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Only the castle of Iassi is shown in the panorama, along with a bridge
by which it is approached, and a part of town is visible within the
right margin. In a short description on the left side of panorama, it is
noted that it was a capital of Moldavia and the seat of its princes. The
town was plundered by <A HREF="../sad/term_33.htm" target="gl">
Cossacks</A>
 in ancient times, and it was thereafter
thoroughly fortified. However, the <A HREF="../sad/term_33.htm" target="gl">
Cossacks</A>
 and Poles took hold of it in
1686 during their campaign against the Tatars. After that, the town was
damaged in the large conflagration. Iassi is placed on the river of Prut
25 - 50 miles (cca. 220 km) away from Polish border.
