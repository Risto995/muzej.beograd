<P>Frontispiece and back cover are of stiff purple cardboard
with gold printed text. Text was effaced in the course of
time and thus hardly readable, and some parts of it are
absolutely unreadable.
<P>
Frontispiece: Title in the form of gateway with an armour
at its top. Above it stands an archway with a maxim:
&quot;Teć'e voda kud je tekla  - srpska majka to je rekla&quot;. In
the gateway fields are dates of important battles in
Serbian insurrections.
<P>
Back cover: At the top stands an eagle holding a snake in
its beak, above the band with inscription &quot;Topolski&quot;. It
is an obvious allegory of <A HREF="../sad/vlad_18.htm" target="gl">
Karađorđe</A>
, the eagle of Topola
stifling the Turkish snake. At the bottom is a fountain
and a maxim inscribed around it: &quot;Pritisnuta jače to na
više skače&quot;.
