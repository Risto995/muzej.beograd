<P>While making a new plan of the Belgrade town and fortress, the publisher
and engraver G. Bodenehr has thoroughly used a large combined plan of J.
B. Gumpp and M. Wening, published immediately after the conquest of
Belgrade in <A HREF="../sad/hron_2.htm" target="gl">
1688</A>
, drawn by Gumpp on the spot. Several elements and
details in the plan imply that Bodenehr used literary sources (perhaps
also the pictorial ones) from 1717, in order to publish his plan.
Elements from 1717 are: the bridges across <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 and Sava (the latter
one is represented as not yet accomplished or demounted); a bridge and
embankment  over marshlands on the left bank of Sava until Bežanijska
kosa; commander's house (G), and a line marked out for construction of
the town fortification  during Austrian government in Belgrade and
Serbia  in <A HREF="../sad/hron_4.htm" target="gl">
1717</A>
-<A HREF="../sad/hron_6.htm" target="gl">
1739</A>
 (F). There is a large number of  elements which
imply the relations with Gumpp's work, but the most significant one is a
lack of Turkish reinforcement of the southern face of fortress by two-
horned bastion (Hornwerck), built in 1690-1692 after the plans of Andrej
Kornar.
<P>
The plan contains an explanation with 18 entries (A - S). Several
important locations and objects have to be noted: inner fortification of
the Upper town (A); orthodox cemetery and church (Q); open space for
communal prayers (O); Turkish cemetery (P); hospital (N), and a mosque
adjacent to it (M); han (inn) and bazaar (K and I), and, finally, a
palace intended for sojourn of the <A HREF="../sad/term_17.htm" target="gl">
viziers</A>
  and the sultan on their
arrival to Belgrade (H).
