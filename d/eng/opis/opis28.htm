plateau below  the rock, irregularly organized and protected by

palisades</A>
 with several towers built in masonry. A wooden bridge leads to
the town, defended by two towers. As regards  the settlement, a church
with pointed belfry stands to the right of the bridge and to its left is
a church with a dome above the belfry - probably an orthodox one. A
four-level fort is situated on the rock above the town. Its first two
levels contain the baracks. A short narrative in the upper left corner
of the picture explains that  it was an old town and that Hungarian
kings and Transylvanian dukes argued about it. The town with modern
Hungarian name of <A HREF="../sad/geo11.htm" target="gl">

 is actually Muka&ccaron;evo placed eastward of &Ccaron;op,
now in Ukraine.
