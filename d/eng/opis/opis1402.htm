<P>Three cannons are represented in the foreground with guns half turned to
the right. Two huts are standing  behind, the left one being higher and
larger. The photographer stood on somewhat lower altitude than the
surrounding terrain.  Thin trees are seen in the  far left.
<P> Note on the back: &quot;Hospital barracks at &Cacute;uprija on Morava&quot;  is
probably  correct, in contrast to the note on identical specimen from
Military museum stating that these are &quot;Cannons in the Upper town (of
Belgrade fortress) in 1875/76&quot;, and that is highly improbable.
