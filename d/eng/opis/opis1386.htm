<P>Hospital shack at Vra&ccaron;ar. A large object built in haste. It contains a
porch and several people, two of them being hospital staff, are below
it. The shack stands below tall trees, and a fence is in the background.
According to the evidence of Military museum it should represent &quot;a
shack with surgery&quot; - a hardly probable assumption.
