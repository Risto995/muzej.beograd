SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF HUNGARY IN THE SHAPE OF ROMAN EAGLE, AND EXPULSION OF THE TURKS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Two thirds of the sheet are occupied by the scene representing a battle
eagle resting on ruins. A title in the upper central part says:&quot;The
kingdom of Hungary released from Turks by the Roman eagle - i.e., the
latest plans and views of all important towns, forts, rivers and roads
in the Kingdom of Hungary and the neighbouring countries, along with the
history of each place from the earliest times until today. The remaining
(subsequently coloured) right part of the sheet, represents the scene of
Turks removing only the most necessary  equipment in  panicked flight
from a building on fire, i.e., Europe.
