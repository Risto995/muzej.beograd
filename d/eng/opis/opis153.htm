<P>A view of Belgrade from the left bank of Sava in the
vicinity of its mouth, so that the fortress and a part of
settlement until harbour, on the terrace of Sava are
seen. Austrian  frontier guard is in the foreground,
passed by a carriage with passengers moving down to the
river bank.  The engraving was probably made immediately
after 1862, regarding a presence of the large esplanade
around fortress, which was created in the above noted
year according to the agreement of Kanlid&zcaron;a, in order to
prevent conflicts between Serbs and Turks by separation
of Turkish fortress from Serbian settlement. The title:
Turkish fortress Belgrade (in German language) - Belgrade
(in Serbian Cyrillic letters prior to Vuk's reform) is
placed below the picture).
