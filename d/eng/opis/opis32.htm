PLAN OF PETROVARADIN (PETERWARDEIN)<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>The plan of Petrovaradin is oriented N-S, according to the mark in the
upper left corner. Representations are as follows: fortified town,
castle with courtyard bastion, along with inner and outer bastion lines
heading westward, both reinforced by &quot;Spanish rhombuses&quot;. South of the
town, outside the ramparts, there is a fortress and settlement of
Maierhoff. Town walls and fort ramparts which face the <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 were not
yet erected. Two bridges connect it to the right bank of <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 and the
roads to Futog and Szeged.
<P>
Just on the right bank of <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
, across the castle, there is Hrvatsko
selo (Croatian village) and a little farther, beyond coastal marshlands,
Srpska varo&scaron; (Serbian town, Ratzenstadt, future Novi Sad). A short
description and history of Petrovaradin is placed on the left side of
the picture. It is noted that the town was conquered in 1687, and that
the fortress was subsequently renovated and reinforced thanks to general
Caprianni.  Finally, the Turks have besieged the town in August 1716,
but were defeated in a big battle by the army commanded by Eugene of
