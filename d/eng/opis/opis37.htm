PLAN OF BUDIM (AND PEST)<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Plan of Budim and Pest with a mark of N-S orientation in the upper
central part. Castle, town and suburbs or  the coastal town are
schematically represented, along with Pest on the left bank of <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
.
In a short description and history it is erroneously noted that  the
town (Ofen) had a Latin name <A HREF="../sad/geo3.htm" target="gl">
Buda</A>
 (Budim), that it lies on <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 and
that it is placed 32 miles (cca. 250 km) away from Vienna. Along with an
approval of its healthful environment it is noted that across the river,
on the opposite <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 bank, existed another town - Pest. History begins
with a note that <A HREF="../sad/vlad_6.htm" target="gl">
Suleiman</A>
 I the Magnificent conquered Budim in 1526. On
that occasion, German inhabitants were released, and the Hungarians
(men, women and children) were smothered. Subsequently, in 1527,
archduke <A HREF="../sad/vlad_16.htm" target="gl">
Ferdinand</A>
 (German Emperor since 1556) captured it, but <A HREF="../sad/vlad_6.htm" target="gl">
Suleiman</A>

seized it again in 1529 and gave it to the son of Jovan Zapolja
(Szapolyai Janos) until 1541 when he has taken it over personally.
Unsuccessful Christian sieges of Budim are enumerated: 1542, 1598, 1599,
1602, and 1684. Finally after 145 years of Turkish government  Budim was
liberated on 2 June 1686. Remains of besiege works of 1686 could be seen
in  representation of the large semi-circle around Budim. On the right
side is an explanation with entries A-E, and at the top of plan is the
number 131.
