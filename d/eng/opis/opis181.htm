<P>A broad panoramic plan of the siege showing a schematic
division of Belgrade to the Upper and lower town and the
Castle at its center. Besiege troops are arranged around
Belgrade, as well as on the left bank of Sava between Ada
Ciganlija and its mouth. Suburbia were not depicted but
were described textually. From Sava to <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 these are:
gypsy settlement, settlement of schismatics - the
Orthodox Serbs, Turkish settlement, Catholic part of the
town, and finally Jewish suburbs. Scenes of the camp
besiege are represented at the bottom of the picture, and
the commander of the besiege army <A HREF="../sad/vlad_17.htm" target="gl">
Maximilian</A>
 Emmanuel is
represented riding a horse, in the lower left corner. In
front of them are echelons of the besiege army with names
of commanders. In front of those is a system of excavated
approaches leading to ramparts, and a representation of
the attack on the main town gate by heavy cannons brought
from <A HREF="../sad/geo3.htm" target="gl">
Buda</A>
. A drapery shaped <A HREF="../sad/term_8.htm" target="gl">
cartouche</A>
 is placed in the
upper right corner, with a legend with 13 entries (A-O).
