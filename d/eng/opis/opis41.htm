 and Sava confluence. An old frontier
is marked (established by the treaty of Karlovac in <A HREF="../sad/hron_3.htm" target="gl">
1699</A>
) running from

 near Futog on 20 June <A HREF="../sad/hron_4.htm" target="gl">

route to Belgrade with places where the troops stayed for prolonged
rests before crossing the <A HREF="../sad/geo5.htm" target="gl">
Danube</A>
 downstream of <A HREF="../sad/geo34.htm" target="gl">
