<P>Representation of Delijska fountain at the corner of Knez Mihajlova and
Vuka Karadžića St. In 1843, the fountain was installed on the location
of old ruined fountain. Delijska fountain was  demolished in 1899. Left
of the fountain stands the house of Jovan Panđela, constructing after
the project of architect Jovan Bugarski in 1872, and it still exists
today. To its right stands the former hotel &quot;Rusija&quot;, a building
constructed in 1870 (the author unknown). Similar to Panđel's house, it
has also been rebuilt and renovated, and today it is known as the
building of &quot;Rudnap&quot;. Knez Mihajlova St. extends into the picture's
bottom, in direction of Kalemegdan.
