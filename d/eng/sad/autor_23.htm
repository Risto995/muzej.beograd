cartographer
<BR>
Famous cartographer from Antwerp. He made a map of world on 8 sheets
(1564), a map of Egypt, etc. His most significant work &quot;Theatrum orbis
terrarum&quot; was published in May 1570. In the same year it had four edition
in Latin language. Until 1612 it had 16 editions in Latin, 2 editions in
Dutch, 5 editions in German, 6 editions in Spanish and 2 editions in
Italian language. He started rather prosperously  as the salesman of maps
and engravings, as well as the painter at the age of 20, supported by his
sister.  Already in 1575 he became the cartographer of Philip II (son of
the Spanish king Charles V). Traveling around Europe he arrived to London
and assisted to William Camden to publish &quot;Britannia&quot; (1856). He was
finely educated artisan and has published several various maps
(compilations), but his work was crowned by &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot;,
printed in well known printing firm of Cristopher Plantin. Original
edition of that work consisted of 70 maps, i.e., a map of world, 4 maps
of continents, 3 (regional) maps of Africa, 6 maps of Asia and large
number of maps of  Europe. The first edition contained works of 87
collaborators, and the edition from 1603 included even 183 collaborators.
It represented the first, modern, richly illustrated atlas which has
reached a very high artistic standard.
After 1579, Ortelius added to the atlas a collection of old maps &quot;Paregon
Theatri&quot;. His work was published after his death as well as &quot;Ortelius
redivivus et continuatus&quot;.
