</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>Old photographs of Russian military photographer I. V. Groman have an important place in presenting views of Serbia
of XIX century. The photographs are valuable for many scholars, often being a decisive if not an only historical
source about a period of their creation. Moreover, their artistic value must certainly not be neglected. Groman is not
well known, but his arrival to Serbia after the break of Serbian-Turkish war (1876-1878) has been ascertained. Photographs
of the environment of Belgrade with many public buildings from the end of XIX century predominate, along with those made at
numerous battlefields of Serbia, i.e, in the valleys of Timok, Morava, then at Jagodina, Paraćin, etc. Besides Belgrade
City Museum, Groman's photographs are also kept in the Military Museum in Belgrade, while photos from the library of daily
paper "Borba" in Belgrade, it seems, are lost. Groman's work exists likewise in Moscow (in the former Central State Historical
Archive of USSR). The importance of Groman's photographs may be appreciated if only a fact is taken into account that the
first photographs were created during second part of XIX century. It also may be confirmed by the interest of learned and
broader public for pictoral evidence about Belgrade and Serbia in XIX century. This electronic album contains all 110
photographs from collections of the Belgrade City Museum and the Military Museum in Belgrade.
