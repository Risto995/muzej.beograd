Known under the nick-name &quot;Younger&quot;. After his brother Cristoph Weigel's
death (1654-1726) he continued the large family enterprise of printing
and publishing. His most important works were three portable atlases:
that of Germany, World and Atlas of Astronomy. The enterprise was later
continued by the firm Schneider-Weigel.
