<BR>
Nevole finished high school at Paradubice, studied technique in
Prague, and then went to Vienna where he obtained a diploma of the
Technical High school and the Academy of arts as one of the best
students. Having returned to Prague, he worked on objects related to
railway. After the suggestion of Janko Šafarik he went to Serbia and
remained there for ten years as the main engineer. In back of the
political change in Serbia in 1858, he started his private work. As
soon as the building of Kapetan Mišino zdanje has been accomplished,
Nevole returned to Bohemia.
