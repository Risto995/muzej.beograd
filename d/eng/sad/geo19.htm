<BR>
Organizational unit of Turkish Empire related to Turkish military-
feudal system, in principle one sanjak provides the army with one
regiment (ordia). In our country there were the following sanjaks:
Vučitrn, Prizren, Kruševac (Aladža Hisar), Beograd, Zvornik, Požega,
etc.
In the course of time, due to Austrian occupation of Bosnia in 1878,
the term &quot;sanjak&quot; has primarily been related to so-called
Novopazarski  sanjak, i.e., the area of old Herzegovina and Raška.
