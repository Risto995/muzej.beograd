After death of his father, his uncle Jakov sent him to Srem to
finish school at Kupinovo, then to Sremski Karlovci (where he
finished two grades of Lycaeum) and Vinkovci where he finished the
school for cadets in 1809. Subsequently he enlisted to Austrian
army. He arrived to Serbia in 1813, where he was appointed for the
voivode of Kolubara district. In autumn, after Serbian collapse, he
escaped to Srem and enlisted to Austrian army as the volunteer in
the war against Napoleon. He returned to Serbia in 1815, and was
killed in the battle of Dublje leading his countrymen from Valjevo.
