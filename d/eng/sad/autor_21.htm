At an early age, at school, his gift  for calligraphy was noted. After he
had sold his estate in the end of 1841, he went to Vienna in order to
study painting privately. He applied for scholarship a number of times,
but without success.  In 1846 he had returned to Belgrade and applied
again  for scholarship, but he was refused as non-talented, and there is
no record about him since.  His lithograph &quot;Beograd u Srbiji&quot; /Belgrade
in Serbia/ was published as a supplement to the third edition of
&quot;Dejanija k istoriji srbskoga naroda&quot; /Contributions to the history of
Serbian people/, by Dimitrije Davidović.
