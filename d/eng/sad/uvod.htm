<P>In the end of 1995, the Institute of Mathematics of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts initiated a sort of "pilot" project with an aim to analyze and publicly present certain cultural objects by means of the new electronic media. Apart from the obligatory equipment - an essential and principal prerequisite for work in the accomplishment of that task, it was necessary to make a choice of the kind and quantity (number of specimens) of cultural objects, in order to represent them in the currently latest fashion to the public here and abroad.
<P>After considerable examination, the choice has been focused to two collections stored in the Museum of the City of Belgrade. A decision was made then to represent a selection of early maps and engravings to broad public, along with author's selection of old XIX century photographs from the noted collections.
<P>The reasons for a decision like that may easily be explained. Early maps and engravings represented a kind of  "hit" among collectors during several previous decades, and on various occasions they were widely reproduced as posters, calendars, catalogues etc. Here and there, in more affluent milieus, even the phototypic publications of large cartographic and graphic corpuses have been published.
<P>A collection of old maps and engravings from the Museum of the City of Belgrade has been publicly represented on several occasions. For the first time it happened in the beginning of the 1950s under, at that time, unfavorable circumstances for graphics and prints. The album of Belgrade engravings (from XVI to XIX century) was published, selected by the academician Dejan Medaković (at that time keeper in the Museum of the City of Belgrade) and accompanied by his introductory notes. The Museum organized large exhibitions of engravings on three occasions, in 1966 for the first time, then in 1972 - each with 80 engravings displayed and accompanied by unpretentious catalogues. The last exhibition of the Museum took place in 1984, when the originals were shown to the public, accompanied by a catalogue of exhibition as well. However, 105 objects were shown on that occasion, i.e., one hundred and one engraving and four old maps. Several times, the engravings and accompanying material were shown within particular thematic and scholarly exhibitions of the Museum ("Belgrade in XIX century", "Belgrade in Austrian-Turkish wars in XVII and XVIII century", "Belgrade under Turks 1521-1688" or within special exhibitions with a selection of the most valuable material from rich Museum collections).
<P>Along with the noted activities, the Museum has occasionally published calendars, with an aid of various publishers, containing the obligatory thirteen graphic sheets - an introductory one, plus one for each month. The last one was accomplished in 1991, in cooperation with Fabrika kablova Svetozarevo (factory in today's Jagodina). Twenty six engravings (40 x 40 cm) were published on that occasion in offset printing, in at that time amazing tirage of 6.000 copies. Aside from representation of graphic production during XVI-XIX century, the calendar was enriched by comments related to the history of the capital of Yugoslavia.
<P>However, an idea about publishing a catalogue of engravings has always been present in the Museum. Unfortunately, it was not actualized due to insurmountable difficulties which have appeared. On the one hand the cost of such an endeavor was enormous - paper, prepress preparations, press, etc. and on the other, the explication of the enigma of old maps and engravings could absolutely not be accomplished in Belgrade itself. Collections in various parts of the world, above all the libraries, had to be explored in order to resolve the filiation problem - origin of engravings, taking over the motives, engraving copies, mode of their publishing, authorship, and all other data associated to similar endeavors.
<P>This, electronic publication overcame a part of the noted problems, but many others remained unsolved. We hope that future work related to publication of the Museum material will contribute in overcoming flaws which may have appear here, and that the entire fund of old maps and engravings will be disclosed.
<P>Regarding a selection proposed here it was taken care that the specimens were exemplary, i.e., that they stand for the whole collection, that old engravings of all sorts were represented - panoramas, plans, military plans and battle scenes. We attempted to make a diversified selection hoping that it would not be monotonous, or worse, to incite ennui. The supposed harmony was broken on purpose - as regards the engravings of XIX century. Bearing in mind all criteria applied in the selection of material with provenance in XVI-XIX century, we decided to represent publicly almost an entire work of local authors and the newly established local workshops. Of course, the noted statement does not relate to portraits and compositions from national history made by the first Serbian photographer and lithographer Anastas Jovanović, as well as to the great work "Znameniti Srbi XIX veka" ("Prominent Serbs in XIX century").

<CENTER><H3>Appearance and development of engravings</H3></CENTER>

<P>First engravings, mainly views (or panoramas and vedettes as they are commonly called in our country as well) appeared in the end of XV and beginning of XVI century due to a development of printing arts and cartographic knowledge in Europe. They represent one of the early media of pictorial information. As a rule, this kind of graphic account was not intended to be artistic, and for a long time it balanced between a mere decoration and an aid in better information. Thus the engravings were often described as historical, reproductive or decorative graphic accounts. Neither of these expressions may explain the engravings thoroughly, above all because a large number of exquisite artistic works appeared during several centuries of their publication. After all, many great painters were engaged in exactly this type of graphics.
<P>However it is necessary to note that decorative graphic accounts, as the means of communication and information, were burdened with number of shortcomings. Primarily, in the very beginning, when the engravings were illustrative supplements in various collections of maps and atlases, or in geographical-historical manuals, their main topics were motives which had to make an engraving more attractive, to increase its selling and tirage. On the other hand, production of engravings was a collective work executed in several stages. Before handing a draft to engraver who transmits it to a matrix - be it wooden, copper or stone plate, an artist was often obliged to consult the literary sources or living witnesses in order to reproduce an image of certain place or event. During the process of production, the engraver had to follow various requirements of the publisher, adding certain details which were not previously mentioned, or deleting, changing, enlarging, decreasing some other elements. Certainly, everything that artists does is marked by spirit and manner of the epoch, and as a rule it happens exactly in those cases when the topic was not adequately known pictorially. This is the reason why the engravings of Belgrade and other, less well known places in Southeast Europe of certain period are incredibly similar one to another. Information used for all similar works is in fact based upon a single prior work which served as a model. Centers of graphic production were located in western Europe, in Venice, Augsburg, Amsterdam, Paris, Nuremberg, London, and other large economic an political centers of that time. Such concentration of technical possibilities led to temporary decline in interest for entire regions. It resulted from the well known fact that important events required familiarity with those regions which were related to clearly defined spheres of economic and political interests and influences. Physical distance may contain the risk of error, and if errors existed in editions of large firms, they should spread like a disease through editions of smaller workshops. A mode of representation of distant places and events was mainly manneristic. Identical approach to a topic became widespread and permanent.
<P>However, a question may be posed about the number and arrangement of factors which were decisive for the inclusion of certain place or event among European topics. Certainly, the number of elements was great, but in the case of Belgrade we assume that the following factors overwhelmed: its "glory", its relation to important even decisive events of the recent, comprehensible past, and finally the preparation of public for events which should take place in the near future. In addition, a continuous interest for all towns which were located on crossroads of trade and strategic routes must also be emphasized.
<P>All the noted elements are almost ideally combined in graphic representations of Belgrade, and therefore it remained a permanent and thoroughly utilized topic in historical graphic accounts throughout Europe. Number of representation of Belgrade surpasses that of the towns which were not only far more important politically, but also more prosperous. During the epoch of inferior information, the events which may have attracted the attention of large number of people were rather rare. Some events which are historically related to Belgrade had almost cataclysmic effect upon the public opinion. Turkish arrival to the southern rim of Pannonian basin was by all means a decisive one. Belgrade remained the European bastion wrestling with Turkey for eight decades. Defeat of Mohammed the Conqueror under its ramparts represented the day of celebration for the whole European West. The fall of Belgrade into the hands of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1521 was received as an omen of universal cataclysm, and even more so because it occurred at the time of great religious and social disturbances. It has to be borne in mind that Turkish wars endangered the existing system of political and social relations, and that Turkey was beyond European concept of culture, law and religion. However, the basic concept of European economy - production and exchange - initiated the increase of cooperation in economy with inimical but rich Turkey. During centuries of European land trade with Turkey, Belgrade was unavoidable in periods of peace as well. And everything that happened to Belgrade during periods of war has also been unavoidable. During Turkish campaigns toward central Europe, gathering of troops, and collection of food and equipment took place in Belgrade. Troops were also resting there in the wintertime.
<P>In the end of XVII and during XVIII century, the interest for Belgrade was increased. After the unsuccessful siege of Vienna in 1683, the joint pressure of European powers pushed Turkey back into the Balkan setting. One of the foci of military actions was Belgrade and its environs. During one century (since 1688 to 1790) Belgrade was the point of four military conflicts with Turkey. Only the warfare lasted seventeen years in total, and some of the battles were decisive for further course of the war - later to be incorporated into history of military tactics. Also the concentration of soldiers and arms has rarely been previously attained in that number. For example, it may be noted that four hundred thousand soldiers were engaged in the battle of Belgrade in August 1717. It also is important to note that two treaties were signed in the broader area of Belgrade: at Sremski Karlovci in 1699 and at Požarevac in 1718. Another treaty was signed in the town itself - treaty of Belgrade in 1740.
<P>Apart from objective factors for the interest for Belgrade, there is another, important subjective factor: historical role of the ruling house of Habsburg in Europe and its interests for Southeast Europe. These interests began with the election of Ferdinand for Croatian king, an act of Habsburgs' arrival to Southeast Europe, and lasted until the end of XVIII century. Relations with Turkey remained to be one of the cornerstones of their policy. Combination of Hungaro-Croatian crown with Imperial title, also owned by the same ruling house, involved physical and financial participation of a large number of western European regions into the conflicts between Habsburgs and Turks. Political interests of the rulers acted as additional impulse for publishing of engravings with representations of Belgrade. This is why German workshops dominated in the entire production of engravings related to Belgrade. During particular campaigns, the camps of European army below Belgrade could be compared with the congregations of rulers, according to the number of crowned heads and their heirs. Many of them were initiators of editions representing battle scenes below Belgrade, for the sake of their own glory.
<P>Engravings of Belgrade in XIX century, however, were made for different reasons. Belgrade was not anymore a big, glorious town, the town of great trade. On the contrary, it was one among many dusty small towns in the periphery of Europe, and in periphery of European interests as well.  It may look absurd, that just at the time of decline of interest for Belgrade, some decisive events occured. The awaken Serbian peasantry rose up against the Turks and fought with them with greater success than Imperial armies did, and afterwards immediately attempted to make up for several centuries of lag behind Europe. A spirit of romanticism and interest for the unknown, for the inceptive capacities of not yet adequately civilized milieus, has been reflected in graphic accounts about Belgrade. It was the time of the first works of Serbian artisans, printed in Belgrade itself. Some of these works, revealed also to the European West, were at least financially supported by Serbian government and rulers, if not ordered by them. It is noteworthy that political events, in most of the cases, were not any more an inspiration for these works, but the simple motives from everyday life of the town and its inhabitants. At the time when historical graphic account has long ago passed its culminating point, one of the first illustrated magazines, the Parisian "L' illustration" published a large illustrated reportage on Belgrade, on the occasion of break-out of Serbian-Turkish war in 1876.

<CENTER><H3>Belgrade in engravings</H3></CENTER>

<P>A historical overview of graphic accounts thematically related to Belgrade must begin with a sheet on which Belgrade was represented for the first time. It concerns a woodcut with representation of Belgrade and the moment when the Lower town was attacked by the janissaries of Piri-pasha. The engraving was published by Nuremberg printer Wolfgang Resch although some scholars relate it to Beham. In the course of transmitting to the matrix, i.e., cutting, the engraver made a mistake, i.e., the plate was not inversely cut. Thus the real view of Belgrade can be seen only in the picture's mirror reflection. Resch' woodcut appeared in Germany in the beginning of 1521, only several months after the occurrence of event it represented. The noted woodcut had for a long time influenced many future representations of Belgrade. A view of the town (without an error in cutting, somewhat smaller in size and without Turks in yawls) appeared in numerous editions of "Cosmographia Universalis" a famous manual of Sebastien Munster, published on several occasions in German, Latin and French language.
<P>A later, much more realistic view of Belgrade, is related to Abraham Ortelius. A view of Belgrade is represented as it appeared across the confluence during Turkish siege in 1521. Similarly to the preceding two representations, this view is also relatively frequent, because Ortelius' work, published under the title >>Ortelius Redivivus et Continuatis<<,  has been reprinted, revised and expanded for many years after his death. Since the noted works, until the siege and conquest of Belgrade in 1688, the panoramas of Belgrade have only occasionally appeared in graphic production. All these panoramas represented the first sight of Belgrade encountered by a voyager coming from the north, down the Danube. Some of the noted works are very precise as concerns the details. However, the elevation of Upper town has been exaggerated in all of them, and therefore it appeared as a high fortified rock. Certain engravings from XVI and XVII century are significant for they enrich our knowledge about transportation and trade on river courses around Belgrade.
<P>A breakdown in the mode of presentation, selection of motives, and accuracy in expression occurred around 1688. Apart from the already mentioned increase of interest for Belgrade and events below its ramparts, some other factors were also significant. Officers and engineers who could make a large number of immediate sketches of the besieged town were present in the huge army surrounding Belgrade. Johann Baptist Gumpp stayed in the camp of besieging army, and after the request of commander, the Bavarian duke Maximilian Emmanuel, has drawn a large composition which fully represented Belgrade of that time. It represented the siege since its beginning until the conquest of town, along with plan of siege, and plan and view of Belgrade. Gumpp's work is invaluable because it also shows isometric views of the most important sacral and economic objects of Oriental Belgrade. Michael Wening published this work in large format, consisting of nine sheets (44,3 x 31,8 cm each) which could be attached one to another, and hence the whole engraving had dimensions 133 x 94 cm.
<P>Apart from its qualities, Gumpp-Wening's engraving had a great importance for future representations of Belgrade: plan of Belgrade was shown for the first time, it was distinctively more accurate than any of the previously made engravings, and its accuracy surpassed many other works from the end of XVII and the beginning of XVIII century. Concerning its rather impractical dimensions, and probably also the high price, it has not been published in later times. Nevertheless, it for a long time remained an ideal model for representations of Belgrade in separate panoramas and plans.
<P>Concurrently with Gumpp's work, another panorama of the siege of Belgrade appeared, published in Rome by Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi. Accuracy of Rossi's representation is far behind Gumpp's engraving. According to his notes, it is clear that good literary evidence was at his disposal, probably along with some older representation of Belgrade, but good sketches made at the immediate spot he did not have. Apart from the two above noted works, a large number of engravings with representation of siege and conquest of Belgrade  in 1688 appeared in the end of XVII century. The work of Romain de Hugo must be noted among them for the accuracy of representation of the battle, although Belgrade itself appears unreal and unrecognizable. By its artistic value, the noted engraving  falls into the category of best works of the entire graphic production related to the theme of Belgrade.
<P>Military operations in the end of XVII century procured more frequent representation of Belgrade viewed from the south, toward Sava and Danube, so that suburbia and ramparts of the Upper town were in the foreground. This kind of representation was also incited by Turkish reinforcement of town defense after they have recaptured Belgrade. Apart from repair of ramparts, the Turks started construction of two double-horned bastions (after Andrea Cornaro's design) in order to reinforce southern face of the Belgradian Upper town. As the warfare went on, it was desirable to know something about the momentary state of the most important Turkish fortress. Termination of that war marked the beginning of temporary ebb in production of engravings of Belgrade, but only for a short period - until the outbreak of new conflict. The period between two wars, since 1699 till 1716, was marked by intensification of cartographic production, so that many maps encompassed large areas around Belgrade, with delineation of new frontier. Certainly, numerous new maps of Hungary, finally liberated from Turks, were also published.
<P>The outbreak of new warfare was followed by new dynamism in rather subdued production of engravings. Numerous military plans, military maps, plans of the siege of Belgrade were published, along with a number of various battle scenes thematically related to the August conflict at Belgrade. Rapid publication may clearly be seen in certain editions of that time. Town panoramas were printed and events which took place there were commented as if they were a topic of the day. Therefore it is understandable that some of the works which appeared in the noted epoch were far beyond previously attained quality and accuracy of engravings. An example of such work  is the engraving of Johann Paul Sedlmayer, published in large format with extensive textual explanations.
<P>The end of this war resulted in expansion of Austria to Belgrade and northern Serbia. Austrian objective was to make a strong fortification of Belgrade, but also an axle for future offensive wars against Turks. Defensive capacities of Belgrade fortress were by that time long ago surpassed. New lords of the town undertook thorough works on renovation and rebuilding of fortress and town itself which lasted for a number of years. Belgrade was fortified according to the system of fortification of French marshall Vauban, the most advanced one in that period. At the same time, houses, store-houses, barracks, government houses and temples were constructed within town and fortress. Suburbia have also developed, outside the town walls.
<P>The above described situation was very attractive for pictorial representation, and thus a number of plans appeared in relation to it. They are accompanied by panoramas of conquered town, and followed by publications of plans of the town renovation. Certain graphic sheets show Belgrade as not yet entirely built, although some accomplished objects are conspicuous within the adopted orthogonal scheme of town quarters. Some engravings are marked by the note that they were published after an approval, implying that Austrian Court and government in Serbia wanted to represent in public their intentions and results of renovation. A number of Belgrade views appeared which are represented here by the later edition of Belgradian magazine "Nova Iskra", because the originals were not at our disposal.
<P>The outbreak of new Austrian Turkish war changed the situation radically. Turkey succeeded to take a large part of conquered territories back, among them northern Serbia with Belgrade. The interest for Belgrade has thus again declined. Only here and there, since the treaty of Belgrade in 1740 till the outbreak of new war, would appear an engraving with representation of Belgrade in the manner from the beginning  of XVIII century. The noted course of events is understandable up to a certain point, because Turkey was finally forced to be in defensive, and strongly fortified town did not attract attention as it previously did. The focus of European attention moved to other regions and events. Another, this time the last, dynamic period of publication of engravings of Belgrade took place in the end of XVIII century, the time of Austrian -Turkish war. This conflict began with great ambitions, but its result was rather inappropriate. Independently from the war results, a large number of engravings appeared, most of them being battle scenes related to Belgrade, siege, and events in Austrian military camp in 1788-89. The cause for their appearance were the already mentioned ambitions and presence of the  Emperor Joseph II. In the military camp he was accompanied by the members of escort, and among them was archduke Francis who would succeed his uncle on the Imperial throne. Presence of Francis of Habsburg has caused further appearance of engravings dealing with siege and conquest of Belgrade in 1789, probably as the illustrative supplements of works about the life and achievements of Francis I. Some of these editions are published even in 1820 when the events from the epoch of Napoleon's wars were already forgotten, and they were much more important than the disorderly led provincial war against Turkey and conquest of Belgrade.
<P>At the turn of two centuries, in 1801, the small engraving of unknown author represented an assassination of Belgrade vizier Hajji Moustafa Pasha in his house. This event is important for our national history and represents the only pictorial document of the noted period and events, when the forces of anarchy in northern Turkish borders overwhelmed the Sultan reforms.
<P>After the epoch of Napoleon wars was finished, and European situation finally stabilized, new works about Belgrade have appeared since 1820. A number of authors demonstrated their art in relation to the topic of Belgrade: Jacob Alt, Kunike, Edward Hering, Wittgens, Jaske, Poppel, Bartlet, Goebel... It is significant that all the noted authors worked at the spot, and Belgrade was represented as the town which should be shown for the beauty of its location on large river courses.
<P>Among the noted works is the engraving by Milivoje Nenadović, the first published engraving of one of our countrymen. One of the authors, Cuno von Quitzow, who is known less well, created the whole album of Belgrade views, and in the end of century, a foreigner, lithographer Wilchelm Kun published a large panel lithograph with thirteen views of Belgrade, concurrently with a small album with twelve views of Belgrade.
<P>At that time, the new technique of photography became more and more popular, turning into the most widespread pictorial media, while the old decorative-historical graphic began to lose its importance. Serbia and Serbian people appeared again on the stage of history after a long absence in civilization development of XVI, XVII, and XVIII century. They however had accepted achievements that were long ago acquired, and they accepted technical novelties - be it the photograph or electric light, with very small delay after the most refined milieus.
<P>The expeditious appearance of photograph in our country dictated the selection of the second unit to be represented here. The first photographer, Anastas Jovanović is already registered in the history of photography. Other photographers were mainly, if not entirely engaged in chamber photography - the ateliers, and thus the collection of Russian military photographer I. V. Groman has been selected. He arrived to Belgrade and Serbia in 1875, before the outbreak of Turkish-Austrian war, probably with Russian volunteers which, overwhelmed by Panslavic ideas, were coming to rescue their Balkan brothers from Turks. Unfortunately, there is little we know about Groman, not even how big his collection was, published after his return to Russia under the title "Vidi Serbii"(Views of Serbia), by firm "Rus. Fot". This collection was especially attractive to us because of the accurate date of its creation (1875-1877). The collection represents, literally, the reporter photograph, taken at the spot, and regarding the interior of Serbia, it shows the extent of misery, sorrow and desolation, burned villages and heads stuck upon the poles adorning Turkish positions. On the other hand, the same reporter's photograph acquaints us with boudoir of princess Natalija, with new constructions built in European style in Belgrade, but in Paraćin and Jagodina as well, testifying both about troublesome and bloody course of events in these regions as well as the pace of inevitable civilization advance.
