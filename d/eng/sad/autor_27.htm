geographer and cartographer
<BR>
Munster studied in Heidelberg and Tubingen. He was immediately known as
cartographer and innovator, but not in small formats. His most important
works are: Typus Cosmographiae Universalis (1532, 1537, and 1555), the
Geographia universalis (1540 along with several editions), and finally
Cosmographia universalis (1544, and a large number of ensuing editions in
several languages). Cosmography was richly illustrated by maps on double-
sheet, important towns (views) on whole sheet, and finally with planchets
within text (portraits of famous people, costumes, animals, etc.).
