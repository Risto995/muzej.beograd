<BR>
German aristocratic family of Swabian origin. During XI-XVIII
century they have gathered important possessions, among which was
the castle of Habsbourg at Arau (Switzerland). After the rebellion
(1291-1315) they were expelled from Switzerland. Rudolph I was the
first one from the family stepping to the imperial throne (1273-91).
He seized Austria, Styria and Carniola from the Czech king Otocar II
and turned them into his private estate. The title of Holy Roman
Emperor was in possession of this family since 1438, till 1805 when
the Empire was abrogated. They owned the title of Emperor of Austria
(since its establishment 1806-1867), and were the emperors of
Austria-Hungaria since pact of 1867 until its fall in 1918. During
Charles V, apart from German lands, they ruled over the lands of
Spanish Crown (sun never sets in Charles' empire), till 1556 when
Charles V, fatigued after religious wars, divided the estates
between Spanish Habsbourgs and German-Austrian Habsbourgs. The
former were given to his son Philip, and the latter to his brother
Ferdinand who was already in possession of Hungarian-Croatian crown.
