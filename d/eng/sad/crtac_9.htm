Serbian cartographer and engineer in XIX century. Data about him are
known thanks to his son, the architect, <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('znaml_3');">
Aleksandar</A>
. It is known that
Jovan obtained a diploma and became engineer at the University of
Budapest in 1838.
In view of the fact that his son was born three years before that, it may
be assumed that Jovan was born between 1800 and 1810, probably in
Hungary. He arrived to Serbia  in 1840, and in 1842 he obtained Serbian
citizenship. He was engaged in cartography. Due to changes on the throne
(1842) he had to leave Belgrade and settle down at Novi Sad.
