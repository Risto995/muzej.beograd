<FONT SIZE=+1>Berge, Pieter van den, (before 1680 - 1737)</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Son of the publisher of the same name from Amsterdam, thus often
confounded with him. Worked in Hamburg and Amsterdam as engraver. He was
printer and publisher as well. He is often confounded with cartographer
Peter van der Berg (alias Petrus Montanus) because of his name.
