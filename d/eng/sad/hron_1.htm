 the Magnificent (1520-1566)
started preparations for the conquest of Belgrade. In contrast to
his predecessors, his campaign started by breaking possible
relations of Belgrade with Hungary. Å abac, Slankamen and <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('geo35');">
Zemun</A>
 were
hence captured, and the harshest attack on besieged Belgrade was in
fact the one performed from across the Sava river, by the janissary
echelon of Piri-pasha. Negotiations followed after the intrusion to
Lower town and a retreat of defenders into Upper, fortified  town.
Belgrade was handed over to Turks on 29. August 1521. Hungarian part
of its crew abandoned the town and had gone northwards by boats.
Serbian defenders and population were displaced - sent to
Constantinople, where an important Serbian colony (village Beli grad
and Beligrad mahala in Constantinople itself) existed until 1907.
