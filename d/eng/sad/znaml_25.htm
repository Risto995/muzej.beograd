<BR>
Sinđelić worked for knez Petar of Gložane who was killed in the
slaughter of princes in the beginning of 1814. After it happened,
Stevan Sinđelić came into power at Resava. He distinguished himself
in the battles of Ivankovac (1805) and Deligrad (1806). He is
recorded in history presumably because of courageous defense of the
entrenchment at Čegar. He set the gunpowder on fire and hence the
trench exploded togeher with all defenders and Turks who broke into
it on 1 June 1809. The pasha of Niš has offered 25 coins (groš) for
each head of the Serbian defenders at Čegar.  After the skin was
torn off, the heads were stuffed with hay and sent to
Constantinople. The skulls of 952 Sinđelić' heroes were used for
construction of Ćele-kula.
