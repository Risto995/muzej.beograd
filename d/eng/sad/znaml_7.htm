When the <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hist_8');">
insurrection</A>
 started, Kolarac escaped from jail and joined
the rebels. During the attack on Belgrade (1806) he bombarded the
Lower town with two cannons placed on Veliko Ratno ostrvo.
Afterwards he distinguished himself in the battle of Suvodol (near
Sjenica 1809). Between 1810 and 1813 he was the commander of

, and defender of the Morava crossing at Kuli&ccaron;. After the
downfall of insurrection, he abandoned Serbia and arrived to Russia
(Hotin). Although he declared a wish to return, <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_20');">
Milo&scaron;</A>
 Obrenovi&cacute; did
not let him. He died in Bucharest.
