<FONT SIZE=+1>Ferdinand I (ruled 1556-1564)</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Holy Roman Emperor since 1556, when his older brother Emperor
Charles V abdicated (having divided the estates between his son
Philip who received the lands of Spanish crown and his brother
Ferdinad I, who received German lands along with the title of
Emperor). After Hungarian defeat at Mohacs (1526), Ferdinand
obtained a title of the king of Croatia, Hungaria and Bohemia by
means of skilled diplomacy. He led a number of wars with Turkey
which supported Jovan Zapolja (Szapolyai Janos, Transylvanian duke)
who aspired to Hungarian-Croatian throne.
