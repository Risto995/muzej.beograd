Milovanovi&cacute; was a rich merchant before the <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('hist_8');">
insurrection</A>
 began. He
joined the insurrection as one of the most powerful people in Serbia
beside <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_18');">
Kara&dstrok;or&dstrok;e</A>
 (Gospodar Mladen -Master Mladen). After the
downfall of insurrection he escaped, staying for a while at Most na
Muri (Mura Brucke),  and then further to Bessarabia. He returned to
Serbia in 1822, and for a while remained loyal to <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_20');">
Milo&scaron;</A>
. However he
was assassinated at Zlatibor, presumably after the order of <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_20');">
