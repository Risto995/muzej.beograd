Respected head of the family, he participated in 1788-91 war as the
volunteer in Austrian army and obtained the rank of officer.
Disappointed by the results of war and behaviour of the Viennese
court he uttered the well known words to colonel Mihaljevi}
&quot;...never a Serb should trust a German&quot; His letter to Austrian mayor
Mittesser was intercepted by Turks and was the cause for the
slaughter of princes (&quot;se~a knezova&quot;) and himself among them.
