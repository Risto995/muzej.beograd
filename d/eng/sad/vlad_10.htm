Son of Prince Lazar, and his successor after the battle of Kosovo.
In 1402 (after the battle of Angora) he received the title of Despot
from Byzantine emperor John. As Turkish vassal, fights on Turkish
side against the Wallachian voivode Mirčeta and against the
crusaders in the battle of Nikopol (1396). As the vassal of Bayazid
I (Yilderim - Thunderbolt) he distinguished himself in the battle of
Angora (Ankara, 1402). One year later he became a vassal of
Hungarian king <A HREF="JavaScript:top.cont.loadInd('vlad_9');">
Sigismund</A>
, who conferred him the government of the
town of Belgrade. In the course of his government, Serbian Despotate
went through a profound development of economy and culture. Stefan
had fortified Belgrade and completed its building, and due to his
clever balancing between Turks and Christianity he succeeded to
unite almost all Serbian lands. He died while hunting near the
village of Markovac Mladenovački.
