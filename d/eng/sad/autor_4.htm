Less well known painter from Vienna.  She painted the National assembly
at Kragujevac which took place on the Day of Holy Transfiguration in 1861
(Preobra`enska skup{tina). Subsequently she had requested financial
support to make a colour lithograph of that work but she was refused.
However, it seems that she succeeded to find the support for
accomplishment of the enterprise, because her works have been sold in
various bookshops in the end of XIX century, under the title: Assembly on
the Day of Holy Transfiguration, the Annunciation in Belgrade, Belgrade,
etc.
